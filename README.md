# Smart Agriculture Object Detection with YOLOv11n

This project demonstrates the application of **real-time object detection** using the **YOLOv11n** model, designed specifically for **smart agriculture**. The goal of the project is to detect and classify various objects like crops, animals, and other agricultural elements in real-time, which can aid farmers and agricultural specialists in monitoring their fields efficiently. The model is lightweight, fast, and effective for low-resource environments, ideal for agricultural applications.

## **Introduction**

The **Smart Agriculture Object Detection** project aims to leverage the power of the **YOLOv11n (You Only Look Once Version 11n)** model to detect objects in agricultural environments, such as crops and animals, and classify them based on health status. The model is trained to identify healthy and unhealthy crops, pests, weeds, and even specific crop species. The system operates in real-time, making it an ideal tool for farmers to monitor their fields effectively using edge devices like drones or mobile phones.

By using object detection in smart agriculture, this project contributes to precision farming, where automated systems monitor field conditions and provide actionable insights to improve crop yield, reduce pest infestations, and optimize irrigation.

## **Features**

- **Real-time object detection**: Detects crops, weeds, pests, and animals in live video streams or images.
- **Health status classification**: Classifies the condition of crops as healthy or unhealthy based on the modelâ€™s detection.
- **Lightweight model (YOLOv11n)**: Optimized for real-time processing on edge devices like mobile phones or Raspberry Pi.
- **Custom dataset compatibility**: Allows for training or fine-tuning with a custom dataset tailored for specific agricultural needs.
- **Evaluation tools**: Includes evaluation metrics to assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision).
- **Visualization**: Annotates images and video streams with bounding boxes, confidence scores, and labels.
