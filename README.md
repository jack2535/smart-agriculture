# Smart Agriculture Detection

This project uses YOLOv11n for real-time object detection in smart agriculture.

## Features
- Real-time crop health monitoring.
- Lightweight YOLOv11n model for efficient inference.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Place YOLOv11n weights in `model/`.
3. Start detection: `python src/detect.py`.
4. Start web app: `python app/server.py`.
